## Before You Contribute
Before starting to contribute, please make sure to:
- **Open an issue** on GitHub or discuss your idea on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/he8QHEC8WP) to get feedback and align with the project's goals.
- Review the [**Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/devhub-ai/devhub/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and agree to abide by it.

## Your First Contribution
If you're unsure where to begin contributing, you can start by looking through the **good first issues** or **help wanted issues**. These issues are great starting points for new contributors.

## Development Workflow

### Cloning the Repository
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

### Creating a New Branch
1. Create a new branch from the `main` branch using `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
2. Choose a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feat/add-new-feature` or `fix/bug-in-matchmaking`.

### Making Changes
1. Make your changes to the codebase.
2. Ensure your changes follow the project's coding style and conventions.
3. Add or update tests if necessary.

### Submitting a Pull Request
1. Push your branch to your forked repository.
2. Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
3. Fill out the pull request template with relevant information and also mention any issues it resolves (if applicable).
4. Reference any related issues in the pull request description.
5. Wait for maintainers to review your pull request.

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating a new issue, **perform a cursory search** to see if the report exists. If it does, go through the discussion thread and leave a comment instead of opening a new one.

If you find a **Closed** issue that is similar to what you are experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original case in your new one.

If you cannot find an open or closed issue addressing the problem, **open a new issue**.

Be sure to include:
- A **clear title and description**
- Relevant information
- A **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Contribution Guidelines


1. **Feature Development**: Enhancing the feature functionalities of DevHub, including features related to matchmaking and user interaction.
3. **Bug Fixes**: Identifying and resolving bugs that affect the platform's performance or user experience.

Every template contribution should:
- Include proper documentation that provides an overview of its functionality.
- Contribute relevant examples or templates that enhance user experience.
